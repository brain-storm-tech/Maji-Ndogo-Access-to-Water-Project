Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains country-level data on population, income group, and access to different levels of water services, including:
Basic water services
Limited water services
Unimproved water sources
Surface water usage

The dataset also includes population figures for rural and urban areas, allowing for a deeper understanding of disparities between different groups.

Data Columns:
Country/Region
Income Group (categorized by low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income)
Population (Total, Rural, Urban)
Water Access Levels (Basic, Limited, Unimproved, Surface)
Affordability and Availability metrics
Objectives
The main objectives of the Maji Ndogo Access To Water Project are:

Assess the overall access to safe drinking water across countries.
Identify regions with significant gaps in water access and affordability.
Compare urban vs rural disparities in water service access.
Support policy recommendations with data-driven insights on improving global water access.
Methodology
This project involves several key steps:

Data Cleaning: Preparing the data by addressing missing values and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting analyses to understand the distribution of water services.
Geospatial Visualization: Mapping data to highlight regional disparities.
Statistical Analysis: Identifying trends and correlations between income groups, regions, and water access.
Analysis
Urban vs Rural Access: A comparison of water service availability in urban and rural populations.
Income Group Disparities: Analysis of how income levels influence access to clean water.
Water Service Types: Distribution of populations by type of water service (basic, limited, unimproved, surface).
Results
Some key insights include:

[Example Insight 1] A significant portion of low-income countries rely on unimproved or surface water sources.
[Example Insight 2] Urban areas generally have better access to basic water services compared to rural areas.
[Example Insight 3] There is a strong correlation between a country's income group and the quality of water services available to its population.
Conclusion
The Maji Ndogo Access To Water Project highlights critical issues in water accessibility across the globe. It reveals disparities in access to safe water between different regions, income groups, and rural vs urban populations. The findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions to address these gaps and ensure that safe and affordable drinking water is accessible to all.

Future Work
Potential future work includes:

Expanding the dataset to include more recent or granular data.
Exploring the impact of governmental policies on water access improvements.
Collaborating with NGOs and governments to apply insights from the project.
